## Introduction
This repository contains the final project of the Big Data Analytics course. The project demonstrates our ability to handle, process, and analyze large datasets using various big data technologies and techniques.

## Project Overview
In this project, we analyzed the relationship between the movement of people in the U.S. and the spread of COVID-19. We gathered different kinds of data from multiple sources, cleaned and merged them, and performed various analyses to uncover insights.

### Key Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Implementation of data analytics models
- Visualization of results
- Interpretation and insights

## Dataset
The datasets used for this project are:
1. **Trips by Distance**: Data from the U.S. Department of Transportation on the number of trips taken and the distance traveled.
   - Source: [Trips by Distance](https://data.bts.gov/Research-and-Statistics/Trips-by-Distance/w96p-f2qv/data)
   
2. **COVID-19 Cases and Deaths**: Data from USAFacts.org on the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths over time.
   - Source: [USAFacts COVID-19 Data](https://usafacts.org/visualizations/coronavirus-covid-19-spread-map/)
